## Changelog Maintenance Rules

### CRITICAL: Always Update Changelog

**Every time you make changes to the codebase, you MUST update `changelog.md` immediately.**

### Changelog Format Requirements

1. **Date Format**: Use `[YYYY-MM-DD]` format for all date entries (e.g., `[2025-11-20]`)

2. **Entry Structure**:
   - New entries go at the top, right after `## [Unreleased]` section
   - If today's date doesn't exist, create a new date section: `## [YYYY-MM-DD] - Brief Description`
   - If today's date already exists, add to that section

3. **Categorization**: Always categorize changes using these sections:
   - `### Added` - New features, endpoints, components, functions, tables, etc.
   - `### Changed` - Modifications to existing functionality
   - `### Fixed` - Bug fixes and error resolutions
   - `### Removed` - Deprecated or deleted features

4. **Entry Format**:
   - Use bullet points (`-`) for all entries
   - Group related changes under **bold headers** (e.g., `- **Feature Name**:`)
   - Include file paths in backticks: `` `path/to/file.py` ``
   - Use nested bullets (2 spaces) for sub-items
   - Be descriptive: explain WHAT was changed and WHY it matters

5. **Required Information**:
   - File paths for all modified/new files
   - Function/component/endpoint names
   - Database changes (tables, functions, migrations)
   - API endpoints with full paths
   - Component names for frontend changes

### Example Format

```markdown
## [2025-11-20] - Feature Name

### Added
- **Feature Category**:
  - Implemented new feature X (`src/path/to/file.py`).
  - Added `/api/endpoint` endpoint for Y functionality.
  - Created `ComponentName` component (`frontend/src/components/Component.tsx`).

### Changed
- **Module Name**:
  - Enhanced function X to support Y.
  - Updated default value from A to B.

### Fixed
- Fixed bug description in `src/path/to/file.py`.
- Resolved issue with X that was causing Y.
```

### When to Update Changelog

Update the changelog when you:
- Add new files, functions, endpoints, components, or features
- Modify existing functionality
- Fix bugs or errors
- Add or modify database schemas/functions
- Update dependencies or configurations
- Refactor code that changes behavior
- Add tests or documentation
- Remove deprecated features

### Changelog Update Process

1. **Before committing**: Review all changes made
2. **Identify changes**: Categorize as Added/Changed/Fixed/Removed
3. **Update changelog**: Add entries following the format above
4. **Verify**: Ensure all significant changes are documented
5. **Commit**: Include changelog update in the same commit

### Prohibited Actions

- ❌ Never skip updating the changelog
- ❌ Never use vague descriptions like "updated code" or "fixed stuff"
- ❌ Never forget to include file paths
- ❌ Never mix dates or use incorrect date formats
- ❌ Never delete changelog entries without user approval

### Additional Project Rules

- Always write tests first, then code, then adapt until tests pass
- Always check the database for proper context before making changes
- Always append changes per day in `changelog.md` with a clean summarized timeline
- Never delete the database - follow all database safety protocols
- Always ask follow-up questions if relevant information is missing
- Always state the plan before executing changes that affect data or structure
