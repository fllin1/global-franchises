## Git Commit Message Guidelines (Conventional Commits)

### CRITICAL: Follow Conventional Commits Format

**All commit messages MUST follow the Conventional Commits specification.**

### Commit Message Structure

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

### Commit Types (Required)

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `feat` | A new feature |
| `fix` | A bug fix |
| `docs` | Documentation only changes |
| `style` | Code style changes (formatting, semicolons, etc.) - no logic changes |
| `refactor` | Code refactoring without adding features or fixing bugs |
| `test` | Adding or modifying tests |
| `chore` | Maintenance tasks (dependencies, build, configs) |
| `perf` | Performance improvements |
| `ci` | CI/CD configuration changes |
| `build` | Build system or external dependency changes |
| `revert` | Reverts a previous commit |

### Scope (Optional but Recommended)

The scope indicates which part of the codebase is affected:
- `api` - Backend API changes
- `frontend` - Frontend/UI changes
- `db` - Database schema, migrations, functions
- `auth` - Authentication/authorization
- `ghl` - GoHighLevel integration
- `scraper` - Web scraping functionality
- `leads` - Lead management
- `franchises` - Franchise management
- `config` - Configuration files
- `deps` - Dependencies

### Subject Line Rules

1. **Use imperative mood**: "add feature" not "added feature" or "adds feature"
2. **No capitalization**: Start with lowercase
3. **No period at the end**
4. **Max 50 characters**

### Body (Optional)

- Wrap at 72 characters
- Explain WHAT and WHY, not HOW
- Separate from subject with a blank line

### Footer (Optional)

- Reference issues: `Closes #123`, `Fixes #456`
- Note breaking changes: `BREAKING CHANGE: description`

### Examples

```

```

```

Fixed rounding error in min/max investment calculation
that was causing incorrect values in comparison table.

```

**Refactor:**

```

**Breaking Change:**

BREAKING CHANGE: The /api/franchises endpoint now returns
a paginated response with `data` and `meta` keys instead
of a flat array.
```

**Multiple Scopes:**
```
feat(api,frontend): implement lead comparison feature
```

**Chore:**
```
chore(deps): update Next.js to v15.0.3
```
